Dear <NAME>,
I am writing to you with a heavy heart and tears in my eyes. I am a Polish prince who has been stranded in space for the past 10 years. I have been living off of nothing but freeze-dried Kiełbasaa. I am writing to you because I need your help. I need you to send me $10,000 so that I can return to Earth and reclaim my throne. In exchange for your help, I will give you 50% of my kingdom and a lifetime supply of Kiełbasa.
Please respond as soon as possible. I am running out of kiełbasa.
Sincerely, Prince Mściwuj
